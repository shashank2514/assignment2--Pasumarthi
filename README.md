> Combinatorial algorithms contains three types Fundamentals,Techniques,Tasks.Now i am taking an algorithm from Fundamentals i.e., Finding Power of Factorial Divisor.

Finding Power of Factorial Divisor- The efficient approach is based on Legendre’s formula. The following steps are followed: While dealing with this problem to find the maximum power of N that divides M factorial (M!), N can be anything prime or composite. Thus, in this case,
First, the prime factors of a given number N are calculated.
Then calculate the highest power from all prime factors that divides M!.
Finally, we’ll calculate the prime factor with the lowest value of the highest power of N that divides M!.In other words, return the minimum of all calculated powers.

Code for Finding Power of Factorial Divisor

```
int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    int res = 0;
    while (n) {
        n /= k;
        res += n;
    }
    return res;
}
```
